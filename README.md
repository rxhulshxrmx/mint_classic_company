# Mint Classics Inventory Optimization

## Project Scenario

Mint Classics Company, a retailer of classic model cars and other vehicles, is considering closing one of their storage facilities. To make a data-based business decision, they seek suggestions and recommendations for reorganizing or reducing inventory while maintaining timely customer service.

 Your goal is to identify parts of the data that could help in deciding how to reduce inventory. You will write SQL queries to answer questions like:

1. Where are items stored, and could a warehouse be eliminated by rearranging them?
2. How do inventory numbers relate to sales figures? Are the inventory counts appropriate for each item?
3. Are we storing items that are not moving? Which items could be candidates for being dropped from the product line?

These insights will help formulate suggestions and recommendations for reducing inventory, with the ultimate goal of closing one of the storage facilities.
