## Recommendations

1. **Warehouse Optimization**: Consider redistributing products between warehouses to optimize space. This might allow the company to eliminate a warehouse, reducing overhead costs. Alternatively, Consider consolidating inventory from less utilized warehouses to more active ones. This can help in optimizing storage costs and might even lead to the closure or repurposing of a warehouse.

2. **Inventory Management**: Adjust stock levels based on sales trends. Increase stock for products with a high sales-to-stock ratio and reduce stock for overstocked products. The products identified as potentially overstocked should be reviewed. Strategies such as discounts, promotions, or bundling with other products can be used to move these products faster. If these strategies don't work, consider discontinuing these products.

3. **Product Line Review**: Products that have not been sold at all should be reviewed for discontinuation. Before making a final decision, consider if there are any marketing or promotional strategies that can be used to boost their sales.

4. **Improve Shipping Efficiency**: Implement strategies to ensure more orders are shipped within 24 hours. This could include optimizing the order processing system, improving warehouse operations, or offering incentives for timely shipping.
